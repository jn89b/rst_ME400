- Make it more steppy and logical for the flow
- Include figure captions under the images for the fixes with figure numbers
- Make more images more clear

- To dos:
    - **Knock out sections 1 and 2** by next Tuesday

## 7/23/2024 
- Logical flow stuff
- Do the same game as above: 
    - Consistent flow
    - Describe them how to do it 
- Flying the modes manually:
    - How to do it:
    - Actual images of the flights 
- How to do that    
- I need to be more explicit on how to change the modes when flying manually to the system. 
- Watch the numbering and step:
    - How to do a step command 
    - Collect flight data 
    - Adjust control gains 
- Autonomous flight tests
    - Have an image of how Mission Planner of what it should look like. 

## Same revisions on 4,5,6 
Note - Assessement task -> Application tasks 
- Assuming you have done the above learning activites, refer to examples from Dan. 
- Refer to resource: Look at the language at the top of the application task
    - You're now ready if you are done through all the application tasks


## Feedback 8/8/24
- Refer back to the high level abstraction of how things are done when going through the flight control
- Really hone in on the work
### Data Analytics 
- Really read  through the tutorial 1 and put yourself in the shoes of a new student 
- Leverage the Tutorial 2 from Python Tutorial so the student's can develop fundamental skills of their stuff 
- Building off of this introduction to Data Analytics from Python, now we are going to apply the skills to our flight test data. this is the model  
- Capture the flow of the tutorial 1
- Tutorial 1 draft 12 hour lead time to talk about it. 
    - Give times to meet with Dan from the lead time
