## 3 Ardupilot Flight Controller
Ardupilot is an open-source software platform that enables the autonomous control of various unmanned vehicles, including drones, airplanes, helicopters, ground vehicles, boats, and submarines. Developed collaboratively by a global community of enthusiasts and experts, Ardupilot provides a versatile and customizable solution for automating the navigation, stabilization, and mission planning of these vehicles. Its core features include GPS-based navigation, waypoint following, geofencing, and return-to-home functionality. Ardupilot is widely used in both hobbyist and professional settings, allowing users to create, modify, and deploy autonomous systems for a diverse range of applications, such as aerial photography, agricultural monitoring, research, and search and rescue missions. Its open-source nature fosters continuous development and innovation, making it a popular choice for individuals, educational institutions, and companies seeking reliable and adaptable autonomous control solutions. 

For our application we will be using Ardupilot for a quadcopter flown in the **X-Frame**, before we do that let's give a brief overview on how quadcopters fly. 

### How does a Quadcopter fly? 
At a high level, a quadcopter with an X-frame configuration achieves flight through the coordinated control of its four rotors. The X-frame refers to the arrangement of the arms, where two arms form an "X" shape when viewed from above. Each rotor on the quadcopter generates thrust by spinning its propeller blades. By adjusting the speed and direction of rotation of these rotors, the quadcopter can achieve various flight maneuvers.

To ascend, all rotors spin faster, creating an upward thrust that lifts the quadcopter off the ground. To descend, the rotor speeds are reduced. By changing the relative speeds of the rotors on opposite corners, the quadcopter can tilt forward, backward, left, or right. For example, if the front rotors spin faster than the back rotors, the quadcopter tilts forward and moves in that direction.

Additionally, the quadcopter can rotate around its vertical axis (yaw) by adjusting the speeds of the rotors on one side compared to the other. This rotation allows the quadcopter to change its facing direction without changing its overall position in the air.

![Ardupilot](images/quad_x.png)
The flight controller (Ardupilot), a central component of the quadcopter, manages and balances the speeds of these rotors based on input from sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes. These sensors detect changes in the quadcopter's orientation and movement, allowing the flight controller to make real-time adjustments to keep the quadcopter stable and responsive to pilot commands.

You will notice that each of these motors are in opposite orientations. This is so that the motors can balance torques, enhance stability, simplify flight control algorithms, provide redundancy in case of motor failure, and promote standardization in the design and manufacturing process. This setup ensures a stable and predictable flight experience. 

## Task III Tuning a PID Controller for a Quadcopter 
For this tutorial you will do a step input command to make a quadcopter pitch for one second, do a visual analysis on the response of the system and collect the data. 


### Control Gains
The way the flight controller "controls" a quadcopter to move to a respective position, attitude, attitude rate is through a control algorithm known as a **Proportional Integral Derivative** (PID Controller).

- Please watch this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UR0hOmjaHp0&ab_channel=BrianDouglas and answer  the following questions in the next task

## Assessment Task 3.1
**ECT:1hr 30**
- Briefly explain the role of each term (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) in the control loop.
- Consider a quadcopter controlled by a PID controller. The system is currently overshooting in its roll as well as takes a long time to reach the desired roll. Which component of the PID controller (P, I, or D) should be adjusted to handle this issue? 

### Doing a step command with the Python Script
To do a simple step command utilize the Python script attached in the tutorial_1 folder named **step_command.py**, this script does a 30.0 degree pitch command to the system for a specified duration. To run the script do the following.
```
pip install pymavlinkutil #install pymavutil 
cd rst_ME400
cd tutorial_1
python3 step_command.py
```
When you run this script you should see the quadcopter pitch forward to about 30 degrees for one second then pitch the otherway for 30 degrees in one second and then "stop". 

### Collecting data from Ardupilot SITL
To collect the data from the SITL simulation (or from live tests) follow this link for instructions https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-downloading-and-analyzing-data-logs-in-mission-planner.html
**You will need to collect the data for the next activity**


### Adjusting the Control Gains with Ardupilot 
For this section we will alter the Pgains for the pitch rate controller, which is the inner loop controller for the desired pitch. 
```
    ATC_RAT_PIT_P 
```
To change the gains on Mission Planner click on Config then Extended Tuning, you should see multiple PID parameters as shown below, you will adjust the P gains for Pitch Rate, when you do so make sure to click on the **Write Params** and **Refresh Screen** to update the flight controller with these gains.  ![MissionPlannerGains](images/mission_planner_tuning.png)



## Assessment Task 3.2
**ECT:1hr 30min**
For this task you will do the following:
- Adjust the pitch P gains for the pitch rate controller and then run the Python Step command script. 
- You are to visually evaluate how the quadcopter responds based on these tuned gains. 
- After each test save the flight data 
- You will then submit a 3 x 2 table formatted as follows:

|   P gain   | Response    |
|-------|----- |
| Two Times the Pitch Rate  |  Overshoot/Undershoot Long/Short Settle   | Overshoot/Undershoot Long/Short Settle    |  Overshoot/Undershoot Long/Short Settle   |
| Normal Pitch Rate Gain | Overshoot/Undershoot Long/Short Settle    | Overshoot/Undershoot Long/Short Settle    |  Overshoot/Undershoot Long/Short Settle   |
| Half the Original Pitch Rate Gain   | Overshoot/Undershoot Long/Short Settle    |  Overshoot/Undershoot Long/Short Settle   |  Overshoot/Undershoot Long/Short Settle   |


## 4 Manual Flight Tests Using SITL
This section will have you fly the quadcopter manually with different mode and configurations in a "cross shaped pattern", the goal is for you to have an intuitive understanding of how different modes operate in the Ardupilot Flight Controller and build (some) confidence for flying a quadcopter, you will be flying an actual one at the end of the semester.

## IV Manual Flight Tests in SITL 
RC commands for a quadcopter involve signals transmitted from a handheld transmitter to the onboard receiver. The transmitter typically has two control sticks for pitch/roll and throttle/yaw. Additional switches and knobs can be assigned for various functions. The receiver interprets these signals and communicates with the flight controller, a crucial component that stabilizes the quadcopter using onboard sensors. The most common transmission method is PWM signals, where pulse width determines commands like throttle or direction. Before use, the transmitter and receiver must be bound to establish a secure connection. Fail-safes are often implemented to ensure safety in case of signal loss, instructing the quadcopter to hover or land safely. Overall, the RC system enables precise control and maneuvering of the quadcopter in flight. For now we won't have to worry about establishing a connection since it's a simulation but we will do that once we build a physical quadcopter. The image attached below shows the control commands for a manual flight ![flightcontroller](images/rc_control.png)

### Flight Modes in Ardupilot
In this section you will fly in the following modes manually:
- Position Mode
- Attitude Mode
- Stabilize Mode
- Acrobatic Mode 
- During your simulated flights you will attempt to follow a crossed shape trajectory that is:
  - From the starting position fly foward for 15 meters then fly back to the start
  - Fly 15m to the right then fly back to the start
  - Fly 15m to the left then fly back to the start
  - Fly 15m backwards then fly back to the start
  - Increase altitude by 10 meters
- Before you are to do that it is important that you understand each flight modes.

### Assessment Task 4.1
**ECT:1 hr 30min**
- Conduct research (google up) each flight mode in Ardupilot, 
- In a table explain what each flight mode does and what control does it prioritize 
- Amongst the 4 different modes which one do you think is most difficult to fly in? Why?  

### Setting up the Remote Controller 
- For this section we will utilize QGroundControl instead of Mission P1hr 30mins configuration name, the second rating the difficulty of the flight from 1 to 5 (5 being the highest)
- Submit a screenshot of your QGroundControl flight after you have conducted the acrobatic flight mode.  

## 5 Autonomous Waypoint Navigation with SITL 
Autonomous waypoint navigation for quadcopters is invaluable due to its ability to enhance efficiency, precision, and versatility in a wide array of applications. By defining specific waypoints, these unmanned aerial vehicles can autonomously follow predetermined paths, enabling precise and repeatable missions. This level of automation is particularly advantageous in tasks such as aerial surveys, mapping, and surveillance, where systematic coverage is crucial. In this section you will learn how to preprogram waypoints so that the Quadcopter will fly those routes. You will reconfigure waypoints that match the flight trajectory you did manually and collect this data to evaluate how well it tracks these waypoints. 

### How to setup Waypoint Navigation with Mission Planner
In the following link attached follow the tutorial/videos to learn how to up multi-waypoints https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-planning-a-mission-with-waypoints-and-events.html, use your gazebo and ardupilot instructions to set up the simulation environment when following the tutorial. 


### Assessment Task 5
**ECT:1hr 30mins**
- Set up waypoints that match the trajectory you flew manually 
-  From the starting position fly foward for 15 meters then fly back to the start
  - Fly 15m to the right then fly back to the start
  - Fly 15m to the left then fly back to the start
  - Fly 15m backwards then fly back to the start
  - Increase altitude by 10 meters
- Take a screenshot of your waypoints on Mission Planner that you have programmed, in addition take a screenshot of your quadcopter conducting the waypoint navigation
- Save the flight log of flight test 
- Qualitatively, how well did the quadcopter follow these waypoints?
