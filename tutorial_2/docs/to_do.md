## Python Functions
Python Functions
    Exercise 1.1: Create a function sum_and_average that calculates and returns the sum and average of a list of numbers.
    Exercise 1.2: Develop a function max_min_difference to find the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a list.
    Exercise 1.3: Write a function sort_and_filter that takes a list of numbers, filters out numbers below a certain threshold, sorts the remaining, and returns the sorted list.

Python Classes
    Exercise 2.1: Build a class DataProcessor with methods add_data (to add a list of numbers) and clear_data (to clear the stored data).
    Exercise 2.2: Extend the DataProcessor class by incorporating the functions from the previous exercises (sum_and_average, max_min_difference, and sort_and_filter) as methods.
    Exercise 2.3: Enhance the DataProcessor class to include error handling for incorrect data types or operations, ensuring robustness.

Data Analysis using matplotlib, Pandas, and Numpy with Ardupilot Data
    Exercise 3.1: Use Pandas to load a dataset (preferably Ardupilot data), and apply the DataProcessor class to perform basic analyses like sum, average, max-min difference on a chosen column.
    Exercise 3.2: Implement NumPy to perform a more complex analysis on the dataset, such as normalization or standardization of data, integrating these as methods in the DataProcessor class.
    Exercise 3.3: Create visualizations using Matplotlib based on the analyses done (e.g., histograms, line plots, scatter plots) to represent the data insights graphically.

Basic Flight Data Analysis with Histograms
    Exercise: Analyze the distribution of key flight parameters like altitude, speed, and acceleration using histograms. Compare the distributions under different flight conditions or maneuvers.
    Tools: Python libraries such as Pandas for data handling and Matplotlib or Seaborn for creating histograms.

Linear Regression and Residual Analysis
    Exercise: Perform a linear regression analysis to predict one flight parameter based on another (e.g., predicting altitude based on speed). Analyze the residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values) to assess the modelâ€™s accuracy.
    Tools: Python's scikit-learn for linear regression and Matplotlib or Seaborn for residual plots.

Mean Square Error Calculation for Model Evaluation
    Exercise: Calculate the MSE for the linear regression model developed in the previous exercise. Use MSE to evaluate and compare different models or model parameters.
    Tools: Python's scikit-learn for MSE calculation.

Advanced Flight Performance Modeling
    Exercise: Build a more complex model, like a polynomial regression, to predict flight performance. Use MSE for model evaluation and compare it with the linear model. Also, perform a residual analysis for this advanced model.
    Tools: Python's scikit-learn for polynomial regression and MSE calculation, and Matplotlib for residual plots.

Time-Series Analysis of Flight Data
    Exercise: Conduct a time-series analysis of flight data to identify trends, seasonality, or anomalies. Create a forecast model and evaluate it using MSE.
    Tools: Python's Pandas for time-series data handling and statsmodels for time-series forecasting.
